## About the Book
Scott Gallagher has been fascinated with technology since he played Oregon Trail in elementary school. His love for it continued through middle school as he worked on more Apple IIe computers. In high school, he learned how to build computers and program in BASIC. His college years were all about server technologies such as Novell, Microsoft, and Red Hat. After college, he continued to work on Novell, all the while maintaining an interest in all technologies. He then moved on to manage Microsoft environments and, eventually, what he was most passionate about: Linux environments. Now, his focus is on Docker and cloud environments.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,13 does not have code files

The code will look like the following:
```
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
```

You will have to install and configure Docker 17.03 (CE) on the following platforms:
